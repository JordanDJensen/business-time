                    A basketball player will be faced with a variety of different situations:
                    <p id="inner-box">You'll see different opponents that use different tactics (pressing, fast breaks, switching defenses, banging in the post, etc)</p>
                    <p id="inner-box">You'll face opponents that have heavily scouted you and know your offense inside and out.And you'll also face other opponents that have never seen you before.
                    </p>
                    <p id="inner-box">
                        You'll see a different levels of competition from youth recreation leagues and possibly all the way to professional basketball. </p>
                    <p id="inner-box">
                        You'll play for different coaches that have very different coaching styles. Your middle school coach might like to press -- and your high school coach might have a completely different style and like to slow things down. You could literally see a dozen different offenses through your basketball career!
